<h2>Three Peabodies</h2>

Malvin was a ten minute walk deep into the forest when he came across what people called; the ‘Line’. The dividing line between everything he knew, the human world, and the fae world. It was not a line carved into the ground or marked by stones and signs. The Line was in fact caused by the abrupt change from the human world to the fae world. On Malvin’s side, the human world, it looked like a normal forest. The ground textured with fallen leaves and broken branches, with small plants growing in-between. The perfect foliage for small woodland creatures to scurry through. The trees were shades of brown, some dark and others rich. Some with moss growing over the bark. There was a mixture of golden and yellow light dappled through the gaps in the growth, creating a swirled painting of the colours of nature. These colours lasted up until the Line, where the colours changed to that of the fae. Across the Line it was instantly darker. No gold or yellow light but shades and shadows, mixtures of black and purple. The bark of the trees was twisted and blackened, no soft green moss grew on that bark. Instead fluorescent mushrooms and what looked like scales gripped onto the bark. Their fluorescent glow seemed to be the only light that reached the Fae Woods. The eerie light diffused through the strange woodland, vibrant and bright quickly fading as it moved away from its source. A gentle wind must have been blowing through the fae side of the forest, Malvin could hear whispering and murmurs amongst the gnarled branches and twisted trunks. The ground on the fae side was barren, hard dirt devoid of the natural detritus that could be found in the human forest. There were no fallen leaves or broken branches for time did not ravage the world of the fae in the same way as the human world. In odd places Malvin could see brave and strange plants piercing through the ground. Spindly and glasslike flowers whose blooms were large and swollen, they looked to Malvin like they would snap the delicate stems holding them up. Malvin faced the entrance to the strange world and felt his hands tremble. He had never been this close to the Line, he would never choose to be this close to the Line if it wasn’t necessary. Malvin heard again the children’s tales his mother had used to tell him. Tales of wonderers in the forest snatched away by imps and ogres; fools who had been enticed away by nymphs and sprites. Malvin rubbed his chin in an effort to stop the trembling in his hands. A number of people who had seen the Fae Forest claimed it was beautiful. Malvin concluded these people were liars, who had either never seen the Fae Forest or did not want to share the true effect it had on them. As Malvin looked upon it now he wasn’t overcome with beauty but fear and repulsion. It turned his stomach. Twisted it in knots of fear. It was at this point that Malvin would usually have turned back away from the Line, putting the fae world behind him, but Malvin knew he couldn’t turn back. It was much worse than that, he would have to proceed forward. Forwards if he was to save Her. Forwards to save Her. He took this thought and repeated it, turning it into an internalised chant.

Forwards to save Her.

Forwards to save Her.

Forwards to save Her.

Slowly Malvin brought one foot in front of the other. Each step unsteady, plagued by wobbly knees. Malvin swallowed, he thought that his legs might stop working altogether and he would crumple into a pitiful heap of fear. His heart thumped in his chest and blood rushed in his ears. the Line grew closer with each step, waiting to accept its latest victim.

Forwards to save Her.

Forwards to save Her.

Forwards to save Her.

As his chant grew in strength and rhythm so did his footsteps. Stronger and faster until Malvin was approaching the Line at a strong stride. A few steps and he was over the Line. Malvin slammed his eyes shut, as though an attack would rush at him the moment he intruded on the wrong side of the Line. Time passed. No attack came. Malvin was left to listen to his rapid breath. To the low whisper and murmur of air through the strange shape of the Fae Forest’s trees. As his breathing slowed he heard another sound, a strange tinkling sound. Malvin focused on that tinkling, he slowly opened his eyes to search for its origin. He had been told about that noise. The tinkling in the Fae Forest was the sound of magic. 






Two weeks ago Malvin had heard the terrible news. It had left him distraught. A wreck and in ruins. He had heard from the healer and wise mothers of his village that things were bleak. They had told him it was all but hopeless, that he should prepare himself for the worse and be there to ease her passing. 

“She won’t make it to winter and I’ll be shocked if she makes it past the month.” The healer had said, and she was never wrong about these things. The ill girl’s family were already making arrangements for a ceremony. Malvin could not stand to see a world where his love was not in it, despite everything that had come between them, so he did not believe what everyone knew to be true. Many nights Malvin had to be dragged away from the healer’s dwelling, after spending countless hours banging and yelling, pleading her to check again, to try a different treatment, to not just give up on her life. It got so bad that his village’s elders forbid him from going near the place, they even instructed that someone was to watch over the healer and keep an eye out for Malvin, ensuring he left the healer in peace. Days passed and his love’s condition was only worsening. He spent little time beside her, more often pestering folk who might be able to help or scouring the villages limited books. Soon her breathing became raspy, the breath catching in her chest. Her resting room smelled unclean with her sickness and her skin had a constant film of sweat. When Malvin felt her warm and clammy forehead it set his eyes stinging, his throat tightening. He knew what everyone said about her was true. She did not have much time left, not if he didn’t do something to save her. That night, the night before Malvin stepped across the Line, his village was sheltering indoors from a particularly bad downpour, including the man he needed to speak to. Elder Manfrey was the oldest of the village elders and the most travelled. He often regaled the children with stories of foreign lands and magics. Malvin had often suspected many of his stories had been decorated with false embellishment. Yet he still came knocking on the elder’s door, shivering, soaked with rain that relentlessly beat against his body. It felt like an age that Malvin had to stand out in the heavy rain waiting. Elder Manfrey opened his door, holding a small candle aloft. Upon seeing Malvin he was silent for a moment, considering. Malvin said nothing. It was obvious why he was there. Eventually Manfrey gestured his head, 

“Come in then.”

Elder Manfrey took them to a kitchen, he walked at a pace slowed with age. The kitchen was a round room with a large stove in the middle. The aroma of Manfrey’s kitchen spoke to his exoticness. Rich scents of herbs and spices that Malvin had not seen in the land surrounding their village. There were strange meats salted for preservation laid out by the window, some were colours that Malvin had never seen meat be before. As Malvin took in the strange sights and smells Manfrey had been bent under the stove lighting the fire.

“You’ll take tea?” Manfrey asked. Malvin could only nod in response. He had been overcome with an apprehension that kept him still and quiet. A fear that if he disturbed Manfrey’s natural rhythm it would hasten the rejection to Malvin’s request, and if he could delay that rejection then he could still keep hope. Manfrey placed a full kettle on top of the hot stove before pulling up a stool and facing Malvin. The crackling of the fire beneath the stove filled the kitchen. “The girl,” he sighed. Manfrey’s expression was pained and sympathetic but his tone was guarded, as though he was ready for an argument.

“I need to save her – I know I can, she can get better I just need-“ Manfrey held up his hand wearily to hush Malvin.

“I’ve spoken to Etta, she says the girl’s very ill-“

“She is but she can get better.”

“Lad,” Manfrey’s hand was up again, “I know it’s difficult,” Manfrey spoke slowly and with his eyes raised. He was thinking as he spoke, choosing the words to best placate Malvin. “But things don’t always work out in good ways.” 

“But-“

“It’s not a question of more to be done lad, Etta’s a wonderful healer and if she says there’s nothing to be done,” Manfrey looked Malvin firmly in the eyes, “then there’s nothing to be done.” The kettle began whistling with steam and Manfrey stood up to finish making their teas. Malvin was handed a slightly misshapen cup filled with an aromatic green liquid. Malvin took a sip. It was sweeter than the tea the villagers usually brewed. Manfrey took to his stool once more. “It’s a shame, more than a shame… to lose someone so dear in such circumstances,” Manfrey slurped from his own cup, “console yourself with the fond memories you have of her.” The older man looked away, a wistful look, as though he was stirring up his own memories. Malvin too began to turn to memory, his memories of her, but each one felt like a stab to his heart. The fresh pain urged him on, he would not sit by and allow her to become a memory.

“But Elder Manfrey, you’re different from the rest of the village, you know things Healer Etta doesn’t. The strange places you’ve been, the stranger things you’ve seen, there must be something you know that can help, please.” Malvin’s eyes were large as he pleaded. Manfrey sighed. 


“Those things are best not brought into this lad, they are not of our world.”

“If nothing from our world is going to work then I’ll need the…” It dawned on Malvin that he didn’t exactly know what he was asking for, just that he was desperate for some last glimmer of hope.

“The strange.” Manfrey finished Malvin’s sentence. A pause.

“Please sir, help me save her.”






So Manfrey had told him of what lies beyond the Line, the Fae Forest where mortal men fear to walk. He told him who to look for and what to listen for. The tinkling in the air.

“Magic lad, that’s the sound of magic.” Manfrey had told him. Steadily Malvin walked towards the sound, the pleasant tinkle that faintly played like a wind chime. Flashes of strange colours swept past him as he walked towards the sound. He did his best to ignore the sights of the forest, staying focused on the sound he was following. The tinkling of magic did not get any louder as Malvin followed the noise, but it was consistent and Malvin began to wonder if it was endless, a sound set off in the distant past that hadn’t ever stopped. Following the tinkle of magic was an easy task in the eerie quiet of the Fae Forest. Malvin could only hear three sounds; the magic tinkling away in the distance, the rhythmic crunching of dirt below his boots and the rush of breath from his lungs. The rest of the forest was silent, no chirping birds or scurrying critters. Malvin came to a stop. He did not know how long he had been walking. He had given up counting trees or trying to remember land marks. The sickly vibrant plants had all began to blur in Malvin’s mind, no longer distinct. Malvin could have sworn some of them shifted colour and shape while he was looking at them. He stopped, allowing himself to catch his breath after the long walk. He was in something of a clearing, at least the crooked trees were spread father apart here. The ground was bare apart from a large stone set firmly into it. There were plants twisting down the front of the stone. They had glasslike stems; clear, thin and spindly, with leaves of bright green and orange emitting a faint light. Malvin found himself taking a step toward the stone, studying the coloured light that played across its surface. It was hard to see but Malvin thought he could make out something beneath that glow, embedded into the skin of the stone like a tattoo. Yes, Malvin could see there were shapes illuminated by the glowing leaves. They were symbols or letters? Malvin was compelled to take another step closer, to get a better look. They were unlike any letters Malvin had seen before, they had the strangeness of an interpretive artist’s work yet were highly structured and organised like the numbers in a money counter’s books. Malvin drew closer still to the stone, now bent at the hip so his eye level was in line with the symbols. They appeared to be shifting like the plants were earlier. Structural lines would hop into other positions or twist around accompanying lines to form whole new symbols. The longer Malvin stared at the symbols the more intensely they registered in his vision. He began to feel them burning against his eyes, the same way staring into the sun burns your eyes. Small tears leaked from his eyes as the blaze of the symbols left imprints in his vision. A dull ache had set into Malvin’s eyes yet he could still not tear himself away. The dull ache grew in severity, spreading across his whole head until he could no longer attend to his other senses. The pain had become so severe he failed to notice the rising volume of the magic’s tinkle. 

“Kreee!” a high pitched scream came from above jolting Malvin’s attention away from the strange shapes. He looked up just in time to see a small shadowed shape leaping towards his face. Malvin threw his arms up to his face. Undeterred the small thing landed on his arms and using small sharp claws scurried up onto his shoulder. A bloom of soft pain radiated along his lower neck, like the pinprick of multiple needles. The creature had bit down hard at his neck.

“Ow! Get off-“ Malvin began swinging his arms in attempt to grab the creature biting at his neck, but it was quick, darting way from his reach and delivering more bee-sting bites. 

“Die intruder!” It cried in his ear, between painful bites. “I’ll tear out ye heart, I’ll feast on ye eyes, I’ll rip off ye head and piss down the stump,” a stream of similar threats accompanied each bite the creature delivered. 

“Yeah get him! Get him!” a second voice was coming from below. Doing his best to protect his exposed neck and shoulders Malvin glanced down looking for the source of this new voice. It was definitely a fae. It appeared like a flower come to life. It head eyes and a mouth set into a dandelion head, a body constructed from several plant stems twisted together. It’s limbs were flimsy, they appeared to be made from wide grass leaves, and Malvin realised it was brandishing a twig, which it was using to repeatedly prod into Malvin’s shins. “Yeah tear out his…, rip up his… cut out the…” the flower fae’s threats kept trailing off. It had a soft musical voice not suited for violence. Unlike the voice of the creature that clung around Malvin’s shoulders which had a high pitched whine of a voice that promised spiteful malice. 

“-slash open ye spleen, I’ll chew on ye kidneys, I’ll cut off ye tongue and use it to wipe me backside!” The vicious creature was unrelenting. Malvin twisted flinging his arm over his shoulders but never managed to grasp it. An idea came to Malvin, he would wait until he felt the prickling pain of another bite, then he could be sure of the creature’s position. He kept his arms still about his head, still but poised ready for action. Sure enough the pricking of the creatures small teeth came, they were being sunk into his left shoulder. Malvin grasped directly for where he felt the pain, fingers spread wide. They found their target. He grabbed the creature with both hands and held on tightly. Immediately small claws were slashing at his hands. “Unhand me ye filthy beast! I’ll cut ye open wide!”

“Oh no, oh no” The prodding of the twig into Malvin’s shin intensified. The creature in Malvin’s hands had wrinkled and hairy skin, like that of an old pig. Malvin heaved the creature off of him and away with some force, he didn’t watch the arc it flew in, instead Malvin looked down and kicked at the flower fae, his boot pushing it firmly back. “Oof.” It cried as it fell backwards on the barren ground. There was a scrabble in the dirt and the fallen flower fae was joined by the other creature. Malvin and his attackers now stood facing one another and he could finally see the creature that had been attacking him properly. It was indeed mostly naked with hairy skin showing except for a leather loincloth and pointed cap. It was still tensed, needle-like teeth bared and small claws readied. It occurred to Malvin that it looked somewhat like the pottery gnomes that people used to decorate their gardens with, except much thinner and with a sharp-toothed grimace instead of a friendly smile. The pair were short, Malvin guessed they were just tall enough to reach the bottom of his kneecap. The flower fae had what seemed to Malvin a panicked look on its bizarre features. “What are we going to do? What are we going to do Krill?” It cried.

“Don’t give away me name to the enemy Lional!” The gnome creature hissed at the flower fae, turning its attention back to Malvin it took a protective step forward in front of its flowery companion. It hunkered down slightly, preparing to leap for Malvin once more. It snarled and let out the same malicious cry for battle - “Kreee!” Malvin held out both of his hands in front of him and backed quickly away.

“Wait, wait, wait! You’re Peabodies aren’t you?” Malvin just had enough time to see the pair freeze before his rapid backpedalling caused him to slip and fall on his backside. He tensed all over, gritting his teeth ready for the sting of the gnome creature’s attack that was sure to come. After a moment Malvin realised it didn’t come. Even the sound of magic settled back to a gentle tinkle like a distant wind chime. Gingerly he peered at his attackers. The two had taken a few tentative steps closer, and although the gnome creature kept the flower fae a step behind, it was not currently bearing its claws and teeth at Malvin. 

“What do ye know of Peabodies?” the gnome creature scratched at the bottom of its mean face. 

“I know that they’re spirits of this forest, guardians, protectors.” 

The flower fae smiled at this and stepped around the gnome creature.

“It knows us Krill, maybe it’s a friend?”

“Ain’ no friend, poacher more likely”

“Poacher!?”

“Yeah tricksy foul mortals ‘oo delight in the kidnap and skinning of ‘em smaller than it.”

“Oh no!” The flower fae hid behind the gnome creature again.

“I’m not a poacher! I-“

“What do we do? What do we do Krill?”

“Taste of its own medicine me thinks, skin it”

“Yeah sk-skin it… filthy po-poesh…”

“Poacher.”

“Poacher!”

“I’m not a poacher! I need your help, I-“

“Right le’s get to it Lional, you tie it down and I’ll peel it.” The gnome creature’s claws were brandished at Malvin once more and Malvin began scrabbling back in the loose ground, keeping his eyes on the advancing pair. A sudden beating sound and a rush of air from above made all three of them look up. It was the first time Malvin had looked up since entering the Fae Forest and he realised even the sky was different. The constant warm yellow and orange glow of the sun was not there to comfort him. Instead a strange orb hung in the sky, an orb that swirled with purple and orange light. The colours of the orb appeared to be in motion, perpetually swirling towards its centre. His accustomed blue sky was no longer there, replaced by a sickly grey, green aurora. A sense of dread began to crawl throughout Malvin as he gazed up, a realisation of how deep into this world he had come, and a question if he would ever make it out. The creeping dread turned into an icy grip on Malvin’s heart as a new voice spoke behind him.

“Perhaps we should see what the mortal wants,” the voice was deep, elegant and regal, “before we cut its fragile tether to its mortal life”. The pair in front of him were now looking above Malvin’s head. Malvin craned his head backwards over his right shoulder, giving him an upside down view of the newcomer. He saw taloned feet clinging to the underside of a twisted branch, stopping the fae from falling into the strange sky. Malvin struggled to understand the rest of the fae’s shape. It was a bird that stood upright like a human. Its plumage of feathers was magnificent, a mixture of the downy brown of an owl and the metallic beauty of a peacock. It’s torso resembled a human shape except for it had no arms, large resplendent wings came from its shoulders instead. Malvin noticed it was wearing a red silk robe without sleaves so its wings could move freely. The new fae’s face was fierce, beautiful and commanding. It had the rounded, feathered face of an owl, with sharp features well suited to a bird of prey.  It’s large ruby eyes twinkled down at Malvin.

“Said it was a poacher.” 

“yeah a poacher.”

The new owl-like fae looked up from Malvin, “no, you said it was a poacher Krill.” 

“Not a poacher?” the flower fae was looking between the other two. With a sudden whoosh the owl-like fae flew over Malvin to stand with its brethren. Malvin’s gaze followed it, turning the world the right way up again.

“Let’s find out shall we?” The three creatures turned to look at Malvin, “well human, why have you come to the Fae Forest?” The owl-like fae took a step towards Malvin, it’s voice was level but Malvin could detect the edge in it. He knew to take this newcomer seriously, and that his answer would determine what his fate would be. A stab of fear went through Malvin as he recalled Manfrey’s warning of the danger in the Fae Forest.

“I – uh, I was told to seek the Peabodies… that they could help me.” 

The owl-like fae bowed low. “We are indeed the Peabodies, guardians of the spirits of this forest and protectors of its ancient magcis.”  It flung its wing wide to the right, indicating the flower fae, “This is Lional, a gentle spirit and fierce friend.”  Lional the flower fae gave Malvin a broad smile before sitting down on the ground, leafy legs spread out before him. It waved its leafy arms over the baren ground in front of it and a plant sprouted through the ground, a large red berry growing at the tip of it. Humming happily to itself Lional began munching on the berry, watching the rest of the conversation unfold. “And this,” the owl-like fae indicated the vicious creature, “is Krill, the fearless defender of the Fae Forest, prepared to deter all who trespass with tooth and claw.”

“Grahh!” Krill bared his teeth and claws at Malvin. He remembered the sting of those implements, they left nicks and cuts on his neck and arms. While not lethal it was not an experience Malvin wanted to repeat. Krill stood down its weapons and looked proud of itself, adjusting its hat smartly.

“And I-“ the owl-like fae threw both of its wings wide, showing of the full majesty of its glorious plumage; it was equally shiny and downy. There were rich, earth brown feathers, some with light flecks, that were shadowed by sharp, slate black feathers. “Am ChiffChaff!” ChiffChaff announced giving another low bow. Straightening back up ChiffChaff tilted its head in a birdlike manner. “What would a mortal want with us?” it took a quick step towards Malvin. His eyes were drawn to the Peabody’s long bladed talons. Those would do some serious damage. 

“Help, it said.” Lional offered happily.

“Help? But we are not genies nor fairy godmothers mortal,” another step, “we aren’t the pixies in your folk’s tales,” ChiffChaff leant forward, intense red eyes boring into Malvin’s, looking deeper within him. “We don’t grant wishes, we do not perform miracles and we do not hand out sprinkles of pixie dust.”

“No, greedy little morons hoard all the sparkly stuff” Krill snarled. ChiffChaff gave Krill a hard stare. The creature slinked over to Lional in an effort to avoid the intimidating red eyes. Malvin thought it was best to be straight with ChiffChaff, clearly he was the leader of these Peabodies. 

“A village elder told me about you, that you have… something that can help heal people,” as Malvin spoke ChiffChaff regarded him unblinkingly. “He spoke of a special flower, a flower the Peabodies used to help him a long time ago.” At the mention of the flower Krill and Lional, who had been bickering and fighting playfully with one another, looked up at Malvin. ChiffChaff’s searching stare intensified. 

“The Hope’s Blossom you mean? That is a very special flower indeed, grown with the very magic of us Peabodies,” ChiffChaff seemed to swell in size and Malvin heard the tinkle of magic rise in volume and sharpness, causing his ears to begin to ache. “We do not give it out to mortals like you.” ChiffChaff began to turn away.

“It’s not for me!” Malvin spoke quickly, voice raised by desperation. “It’s for my- for someone very important in the village,” ChiffChaff tilted its head once more. “She’s really sick and, and everyone says she hasn’t got long… but she can’t- I can’t lose her,” Malvin had tears running down his cheeks, “please! I’ll do anything, I’ll give you anything you want!” Malvin moved forward onto his knees, his eyes now level with ChiffChaff’s, red boring into brown. 

“Anything? That’s a high offer here in the Fae Forest,” ChiffChaff raised the talons of one foot to inspect, “where we can take anything.” The tinkling sound had become a severe ringing, Malvin’s vision shook and the wetness on his face now had a coppery taste to it as it ran over his mouth. He held out his hand, palm up towards ChiffChaff. His hand shook with the effort as magic cascaded around his skull. It was an empty hand, an attempt to show the Peabody his appeasement. That he would gladly sacrifice anything, as long as it would save Her. Malvin slumped over onto his side under the strange onslaught. He was now peering up at ChiffChaff, wondering how pitiful he looked to the Peabody. He just hoped it was a pitying creature. Malvin was left to suffer a moment longer before ChiffChaff flapped its wings once dispelling whatever cruel magic had been at play. It stalked over to the other Peabodies. The brutal ringing had subsided to the gentle tinkling once more and Malvin sucked in great breaths of air as he realised that he had not been breathing. As Malvin lay recovering on the ground his hearing began to return and he could hear the Peabodies’ distinct voices muttering away. Malvin couldn’t make out the words but knew they were deciding whether he would be leaving with the Hope’s Blossom or if another fate awaited him entirely. With no small effort Malvin pointed his face in the direction of the Peabodies. Still unable distinguish what they were saying, but through watery eyes he could watch their debate. His vision was tinted red and fuzzy, the strange world falling in and out of focus. Lional had wide eyes on its flowery face, looking slowly between the other two Peabodies, only occasionally opening its mouth to voice its opinion. Most of the talking appeared to be done by Krill, its mouth contorting viciously around the rows of needle teeth. It spoke very animatedly using its clawed hands for ferocious effect. Whenever ChiffChaff interjected, its beak moving calmly, the other two would stop and look up at it, eager to listen. Malvin began to heave himself up off the ground, he wiped at his face, tears mingled with blood and sweat. He stood slowly, his legs shaky. The Peabodies had finished their discussion, ChiffChaff having the final word. As they approached the tinkling of magic grew a little louder, and Malvin swallowed his fear. Despite the power ChiffChaff had demonstrated he would not take no for an answer. His heart thumped. An image of Her in her bed formed in his mind, skin glistening with sweat, hair dirty and unkempt, breath weak and rattling. Malvin ignored the prickling of his eyes that the image brought, instead clenched his fists and attempted to steady his breathing. The Peabodies approached slowly. Despite their smaller stature they were no less intimidating. 

“What you want we don’t have, but we can show you where it is.” 

Hope began to flap its wings in Malvin’s heart.

“Yeah and ye’re not going to like collecting it!” Krill gnashed its teeth at Malvin.

“Where can I find it?”

“We will lead you to it.” ChiffChaff flapped its wings and took to the sky, circling above lazily. Krill bent its knees allowing Lional to clamber on to its back before scurrying off. “And do try and keep up mortal.”





The Peabodies took Malvin through an everchanging landscape. Things that looked like plants appeared out of nowhere, their colours in a constant flux. They passed bushes and hedges, some that looked normal and green, while others looked more like purple goo, dripping off of black branches. Glowing blue neon ivy stretched across trees like spiderwebs. Thorny flowers with crumpled faces tugged at his trousers. Malvin lost sight of Krill and Lional on several occasions, the Peabody darting through the bizarre undergrowth untroubled. ChiffChaff too was untroubled traversing through the Fae Forest, it effortlessly soared through the air, beating its powerful wings in a slow rhythm. Thankfully though ChiffChaff stayed within Malvin’s vision. Swooping low when thick ribbon like leaves obscured the grey-green sky, providing Malvin a constant beacon that he could follow as he stumbled through the world he did not belong in. The surroundings appeared to shift continuously, as though he was walking on the spot and everything changed around him instead of walking forwards and distant things getting closer. It was hard for Malvin to keep track of how far or how long he had been walking. After an unknown amount of time walking an unknown distance the Peabodies had brought Malvin to a pond. Krill and Lional burst out of the undergrowth and came to a stop on yellow grass at the edge of the pond. ChiffChaff flew down onto a tall rocky outcrop at the back of the pond. The outcrop appeared to Malvin like a cliff edge, sheer and towering. ChiffChaff looked small perched high on the uneven surface. Surrounding the pond were broken up pieces of rock that ranged from the size of pebbles to wagon wheels. They were all the same type of strange, dark black rock, darker than slate with a hint of purple writhing within them. Malvin suspected those flecks of purple were a sign of magic set deep in the stones. A suspicion backed up by the wind chime sound of the magic gently playing across the whole area. The surface of the pond was perfectly still, showing no signs of being vibrated by the sound. It was a light blue colour, like the sky of the human world on an early spring day, and not overly wide, it could fit perhaps two people in it who wanted to bathe their feet. Upon reaching the pond’s edge Malvin looked at the Peabodies, unsure of what they wanted. 

“Look down to the bottom.” ChiffChaff nodded his head at the pool. Malvin stepped up to the very edge of the pond, peering down into the clear blue water. It was a lot deeper than Malvin had expected. The pond was a deep cylinder carved out of the earth and rock beneath. It was hard to see all way down as the light struggled to penetrate such a large volume of water, although Malvin thought he could see something glinting at the bottom. Malvin checked his footing, making sure he wouldn’t tumble in as he leant over further, trying to make out the bottom of the pond. On further inspection Malvin could see that the glinting was more of a glow. A golden glow emanating from… a flower? It hadn’t fully opened yet if it was a flower, mostly closed and kept close to the rock bottom of the pond. Yet it still glowed beautifully in the water. The more Malvin stared at the flower the stronger the warm glow seemed to get, he thought it was practically shining gold light now. Malvin felt his spirits lift looking at it. “That is Hope’s Blossom,” ChiffChaff’s elegant voice interrupted Malvin’s thoughts, “You must acquire it for us.”

“That’s my favourite flower.” Lional had huddled up to Malvin’s legs looking down into the pond as well. It looked up at Malvin, beaming with the biggest smile ever seen on a dandelion. Malvin couldn’t help giving a small smile back, the Peabody’s pleasant disposition was heartwarming. Turning away from Lional he looked back at the pool, this time with a more assessing eye. How deep was the pond? Could he swim down far enough? Would he be able to hold his breath long enough?

“How deep is it?” Malvin asked.

“Oh a lot deeper than ye think!” Krill was lounging by one of the dark rocks, cackling away in delight. Malvin gave it a few more seconds thought; well he had to try. Malvin pulled off his shirt and removed his boots one at a time, hopping on alternate legs. He placed his bare toes at the edge of the pond, whiskers away from the water. Malvin took a moment again to study the deep pool, specifically he was looking for any creatures that might be dwelling within the still water, perhaps hidden away in the rocky sides. Fae creatures were notorious for playing tricks. Tricks that often ended in people’s demise. They would see it as a great big joke convincing Malvin to dive into this pool where an eel or some such creature was waiting to wrap itself around him, dragging him down to the bottom to drown. There were no deep crevices in the rocky walls of the pond, nowhere he could see that a creature would be able to conceal itself. There was a sudden smack on the back of his calf.

“ye waiting for it to dry up? Hurry up will ye,” 

Malvin looked down to see Krill gleefully rubbing its small clawed hands together.

“Now now Krill, we mustn’t interfere,” ChiffChaff’s voice sounded sharp coming down from above, “the mortal must decide to get Hope’s Blossom on his own.”

“I know, I know, just taking forever and I’m getting hungry.” The grumpy Peabody skulked off back towards a rock it could lie near. Malvin took a breath and tensed up, ready to flee or fight. Slowly Malvin brought his foot to the water in the pond, just dipping his toes past the surface. A loud involuntary gasp escaped Malven. Stabs of bitter, icy pain attacked his foot. The water was beyond freezing cold. He drew his foot back violently, with such speed that it toppled Malvin over backwards onto the ground. The air became rich with laughter; a mean cackle from Krill, joyous trills from Lional and a gentle chuckle from ChiffChaff. Malvin heaved himself up.

“It’s glacial!” Malvin cried.

“And ye have to get to the bottom.” Krill cackled gleefully. Malvin looked up at ChiffChaff, it’s red eyes were hard and unblinking as it stared down at him.

“You wish me to freeze to death?” Malvin tried to remove any trace of fear or panic from his voice. He did not believe he was successful. The cold stare of ChiffChaff did not change, he felt himself begin to tremble under that stare and the urge to flea rose up within him like a bile. He tried to think of Her, struggling for breath in her bed, doomed unless he could save her. Despite his best efforts fear was setting in, another thought kept creeping into his mind. He imagined the cold of the water biting into him, gasping in the icy liquid, shock sending his body spasming. Limbs and joints stiffening as he froze to death or drowned… or both. A tugging on his trousers brought him out of his thoughts. Malvin looked down to see Lional’s leafy green arm tugging on his trouser cloth. It’s eyes were big and hopeful.

“I believe you can do it.” Lional smiled.

“Lional!” ChiffChaff barked a warning.

“Sorry, sorry.” It scurried away from Malvin. That was all it took, a little bit of encouragement and Malvin’s courage was back. 

Forwards to save Her.

Forwards to save Her.

Forwards to save Her.

He brought forth the old chant, a step forward with each line. 

Forwards to save Her.

Forwards to save Her.

Forwards to save Her.

Two more steps and he was out over the pond, falling, splashing through the surface. Icy water assaulted him from all sides. So bitterly cold the air was forced out of his lungs in a guttural gasp. Malvin was plunged fully underneath the water, icy fingers stroking all the way up to his hair. He bobbed back to the surface, lungs already burning. He desperately began sucking in air, trying to stop the shock from the cold, trying to return his breathing to normal. After a few moments Malvin noticed something strange occurring. The water he was floating in began to lose its icy chill, the cold retreating away until the water became… pleasant, like a dip in a warm spring. Malvin looked up accusingly at ChiffChaff, he could see the amused glint in its eyes. Krill was cackling again and Lional was cheering. It seemed as though this had been one of their tricks, a pond enchanted to feel colder than it was. 

“Now the blossom.” ChiffChaff encouraged. Malvin found that it was difficult to see the blossoming flower now he was in the pond. Even the gentle movements he used to stay afloat caused the water to ripple and disturb the image beneath. Malvin couldn’t determine the depth of the pond while the surface was disturbed. He just had to try swimming down. Malvin took in a deep breath before submerging once more. Without the biting cold Malvin could move his limbs freely. He pulled himself down through the water going as far as he could with each stroke. A burning pressure began building in his chest, intensifying with each stroke. He didn’t think he had made it halfway down towards the glowing flower when he came to the realisation he was running out of air. Worry began to set in, quickly turning into panic, if he went too far down he wouldn’t be able to reach the surface. Malvin looked wildly around, he wasn’t even close to being able to grab the blossom, he looked for something to reach it with, a branch or vine perhaps but there was just the flat rock edges of the pond. A small muffled yelp escaped Malvin as the desire to breathe out reached its peak. He turned back, abandoning this attempt and swam as fast as he could. Once he broke the surface of the pond he thankfully gulped the air, heaving in lungfuls as he waited for his breathing to return to normal. As soon as it did he tried again, plunging down into the water swimming as hard and as fast as he could. Again he had to turn back, retreating to the life giving air. Several more attempts were made to reach the glowing blossom at the bottom of the pond. Each time he reached a shorter distance than the last attempt. Frustration was getting to Malvin. On his last attempt he could barely stay below the water more than ten seconds, his body already so deprived of air. Malvin pulled himself onto the pond edge, his legs still in the water. He sat there for a while breathing heavily, trying to recover, all the while the Peabodies mocked him.

“Kahaha, the mortal’s forgot how to swim!” Krill cackled, apparently finding the situation side-splittingly funny as it rolled around on its back. 

“Doesn’t know it’s up from its down.” Lional joined in good humouredly. 

“Wishes it had the fins of a goldfish not just the brains of one, kahaha,”

“Brains and smell!”

“Kahahaha!” The goading caused the blood to pound in Malvin’s ears, matching the pounding of his heart. His body grew hot with anger or shame, his love’s life hung in the balance, he would not just give up.

“It certainly looks beaten, surely it will return to its world defeated and with a heavy heart.” ChiffChaff had amusement in its red eyes. Malvin thought he saw a glint of something else in those amused rubies. He would not return, could not return, empty handed just to watch Her die. What could he do? Malvin glanced down again at Hope’s Blossom, so deep beneath the water.  He couldn’t swim to it, he couldn’t swim fast enough to get down that deep before running out of air. He needed a way of getting down quicker of being… heavy! Malvin flicked his eyes around at the dark stones scattered around. Stones… heavy stones that would sink right down to the bottom of the pond the moment they splashed through its surface. Malvin was on his feet now, mind racing. He felt at his pockets, they were relatively deep, able to fit a few of the medium stones that were the size of his fists. Then perhaps some of the really large stones he could hold onto and let the weight of them drag him down to the bottom. Malvin began looking at the nearest dark stones, trying to assess which of them would be best suited for the job. He had plenty of choice, the area around the pond was speckled with the glinting opaque rocks.  With his mind made up Malvin set to collecting them. As he reached towards one of the dark stones the faint purple glow intensified. The moment his skin came into contact with the stone a strange sensation came over him. A pulling at the back of his mind, drawing him away from the present moment. Malvin found his mind’s eye casting backwards in time, something was searching through his memory. An image formed, it was bereft of colour. He was with people he had not seen in a while, they were not happy to see him but were there out of duty. It was Her father and brother, their faces stern and forlorn. Malvin was just a horrible passenger in his own memory, watching it unfold exactly as it had done weeks ago. Her family spoke to him in short abrupt sentences, keeping to facts, and once again Malvin felt the same crushing dread and the desperate belief that those facts were false. He saw himself push past the two men, then he withdrew his hand from the dark stone and the memory was gone. Malvin was once more in the Fae Forest with the strange Peabodies around him.

“What was that?” Malvin gasped turning round to face the three.

“A curios quality the rock has around the pool, perhaps they act to balance the positive effects of Hope’s Blossom,” ChiffChaff answered with a severe gaze, “touching the rocks brings forth the darker memories you mortals hide, squashed away.” ChiffChaff’s red eyes remained focused on Malvin, “what did you see?”

“All the times ye fell face first into cow shit!” Krill cackled at him, Lional chuckled along shaking its flowery head from side to side. Malvin remained silent. It was the memory of when he found out She was ill and it had torn the wound open inside him. The sorrow, guilt and desperation were all fresh and alive in him once more, a cascade of emotion that threatened to overwhelm him. A sob caught painfully in his throat and tears blurred his vision. She had fallen ill and he wasn’t even there to notice when she did. He had been a dreadful husband, but he could do this, he could save her. Malvin set about gathering the rocks he needed, each one dredging up a memory that fuelled his inner turmoil. Some from his days as a youth and a young man but most were about Her. The first time he saw her in her sick bed, the awful fights and arguments they had… the day she said she was leaving him. Now Malvin stood at the edge of the pool, stones stuffed into his trousers, heaving heavy rocks in his arms. Tears were spilling from his eyes,  rolling off his cheeks and splashing on his chest. Flashes of monochromatic memory constantly flowing through his mind, the memories of Her lingered and took hold of his thoughts. How could he have let her walk away? Why didn’t he create a life she wanted to live? The best thing in his life and he’d drove her away. Why…? He didn’t know. He just knew that somewhere along the way she had become an afterthought, a mere presence in his life rather than the person he should love and cherish most. Then she was not even a presence, she had left and still Malvin had done nothing. He had not even been there for her as she became ill. Heaving sobs rolled throughout Malvin as the sadness overwhelmed him. He took a step forward. The water felt welcoming this time, not icy cold but an almost velvety warmth enveloping him. He could almost imagine sinking into a bed of the most comfortable fabrics. The heavy stones did their job and Malvin sunk to the bottom of the pond, fast. In no time at all his feet landed on the rocky bottom. The glow of Hope’s Blossom was now directly on him, but Malvin wasn’t paying attention. He was still lost in his memories, still clinging on to the rocks. His chest began to feel tighter but he barely noticed, still consumed with the knowledge that he had let Her down. He had made such a mess of things. A dangerous thought began to crawl through his sorrow riddled mind… He could stay in the water, at the bottom of the pond, deep within the Fae Forest, far away from anything else he could ruin. He had become a nuisance in the village, they would not mourn his loss. In this water he could do no wrong, he wouldn’t let good things slip away, he could hold on to them as tightly as he was holding the dark stones. Somewhere in Malvin’s darkened mind an awareness of a burning sensation struggled to rise to the surface. Down at the bottom of the pond was better, thought Malvin. Everything would be better without him.





Cressida.

Her name sounded like a gentle windchime in his mind. 

Cressida.

It danced to the faint music.

Cressida.

Cressida will be better without him. Cressida could live a happier life without him. Cressida is… she’s dying! The thought jolted him back to the present, dragged him out of his sorrowful memories. He remembered that Cressida’s last hope was glowing like the sun within arm’s reach. Malvin dropped the stones in his arms, letting them fall down to the bottom of the pond and his bad memories fell away with them. He felt the burning sensation all too intensely now, it was his lungs screaming at him to get a move on. He fished out the remaining lumps of dark stone from his pockets, fiercely burying the hopelessness and despair they brought. He stooped down low, took hold of the Hope’s Blossom and wrenched up. It yielded easily. Malvin kept his hand clenched around it tight, only a small amount of the flowers glow seeped through his hand, it felt warm to his skin. He had it, he let elation fill his heart and provide fuel to his legs as he sprung upwards. The small disc of light that marked the top of the pond seemed so far away and Malvin was already in desperate need of air. He swam upwards as fast as he could, urging his legs and arms onwards. The disc grew larger above him. He had spent too much time clinging to the rocks. Dark swirls and eddies bit into the edges of his vision, he had slowed drastically. Each kick and stroke demanded more and more effort. There was a ringing in his ears and his chest was about to burst. Malvin could see the mouth of the pond, close but out of reach. He had spent the last of his energy, saved the last of his breath. He slowed to a stop, his vision darkening. The water became still. His last feeling was a warmth in his hand. Hope’s Blossom grew warmer and warmer until it was burning. A burning that spread down his arm, across his chest to his other arm and down his spine to his legs. Reinvigorating them, pouring hot new energy into his body. Malvin’s vision came back and he didn’t hesitate, lashing out fiercely with the new energy, propelling himself upwards. With a great gasp Malvin broke through the pond surface, gratefully allowing air to flow into his lungs. He dragged himself over to the edge of the pond, slumping half-in half-out of the water. The hand containing the Hope’s Blossom was extended out in the dirt. Gently Malvin opened his hand, he hoped the flower hadn’t been damaged. There was still a golden glow being emitted and Malvin could hear the telltale tinkle of magic coming from it. His face broke into a smile. He had done it. ChiffChaff’s talons slammed down onto Malvin’s outstretched wrist, pinning it to the ground. It’s sharp talons lightly cutting into Malvin’s skin. 

“Gah!” Malvin gasped in pain. With its other talon ChiffChaff reached down and plucked the Hope’s Blossom from Malvin’s outstretched hand, lifting the flower closer to its face. The gentle glow caused ChiffChaff’s eyes to sparkle ruby red. 

“Perfect.” ChiffChaff said with a smile.

“Wait- wait, I got it, I did what you asked,” desperation forced the words out of Malvin’s mouth. He gazed up at ChiffChaff with wide pleading eyes.

“Indeed you did, and rather splendidly too,” ChiffChaff casually threw the Hope’s Blossom towards the other Peabodies. Lional ran forwards eagerly, and promptly fumbled the catch. “Most who come for the Hope’s Blossom turn away at the cold, the rest drown in their darkness.” ChiffChaff continued peering down at Malvin. The bright red eyes of the Peabody seemed amused, or pleased thought Malvin. 

“So… what now?”

“Now? Now we teach you how to use it.” And with this ChiffChaff took to the sky beating its impressive wings. Windchimes began ringing in Malvin’s ears with the intensity of alarm bells. He felt the air flowing from ChiffChaff’s wings, beaten downwards. Despite ChiffChaff’s size the wind emanating from his flying was far greater than it should be. It whipped around Malvin and pulled at his clothes, growing stronger and stronger. The roar of the wind mingled with the ringing of ChiffChaff’s magic overwhelmed Malvin’s hearing. He could see Lional and a grumpy looking Krill. It was gesturing around with sharp hand movements, it’s mouth turned down at the edges as it mouthed inaudible words. Lional was smiling and appeared to be saying something to Malvin. ChiffChaff’s winds began to pick up dust and small pieces of dirt, sending them spiralling into the air until Malvin’s vision was obscured and he had to cover his face with his arm. Malvin braced against the assault, he felt a strange feeling, like being pulled apart. Then it stopped. There was no dust and dirt battering against him, no winds roaring as it pulled at him. The sound of magic had once again settled to a gentle tinkle in the background. Slowly Malvin lowered his arm and to his surprise he was no longer at the rocky outcrop with the pond. Malvin wasn’t sure where he’d been taken. It was dimly lit and when he looked up it was rock he saw rather than sky. A cave of some sort?

“We’re home!” cried a cheerful voice from below Malvin. Looking down he saw Lional scurrying out from between his legs. It still held the glowing Hope’s Blossom in its hands. Malvin felt a weight on his back shift and heard the scratching of claws as Krill scurried down between his shoulder blades and around his waist before hopping off onto floor.

“Don’t touch me stuff mortal!” it snarled at Malvin before stalking off after Lional. Malvin took a moment to look around the cave he found himself in, the home of the Peabodies. There were green and purple tangles of glittering vines hanging from the stone roof of the cave, the corners were littered with mushrooms and other strange fruiting fungi. Malvin realised it was a small cave only a few paces deep. Set against the back of the cave was a rickety shelf stack that looked like it was made up of broken and discarded wooden boxes. In fact Malvin wasn’t sure how it was standing, oddly shaped wood led upon other fully formed planks, sometimes smaller than the one above it, and with only the occasional binding of a green fibrous plant wrapped around two or three of the joins. The shelves themselves were loaded with all sorts of strange items. Glass bottles and vials, many in unusual shapes, filled with fluids, beads or grains that Malvin didn’t recognise. There were cuts of plants dried and bundled together. Something on the shelves was releasing pungent and sweet scents. Malvin realised that he recognised some of the scents from Manfrey’s kitchen.

“Elder Manfrey was here?” All three of the Peabodies turned to look at Malvin. 

“You know Manfrey?” Lional asked with big eyes.

“He’s an elder at my village.” There was a sudden flurry of movements and Lional and Krill were at his feet calling up at him.

“How is he!”, “What’s he hunting these days?”, “does he still play the flute?”, “how’s his knee?”, “does he speak with Melony?”, “does he need more knives?”, “does he need more airfly dust?”… and on it went for a good few moments. Malvin stepped back, slightly alarmed. He looked up at ChiffChaff.

“Manfrey was very well liked in the Fae Forest,” it said with fondness in its voice. “leave the mortal alone, it is time to make the tincture.” ChiffChaff had landed on a large black pot, perching on its long wooden handle. There appeared to be a fire burning away underneath the pot but Malvin had not seen it being lit. The other two Peabodies fell silent at ChiffChaff’s words and hopped on over to the pot. ChiffChaff held out a talon and Lional gently handed the Hope’s Blossom to ChiffChaff before trotting away to the odd shelves where Krill was clambering about picking up different bottles and ingredients. “We will use the Hope’s Blossom to make a tincture that will cure your… important person.” ChiffChaff said to him, “You don’t have to stay and watch.” Lional and Krill returned to the pot each with handfuls of ingredients.

“No I’ll stay,”

“Very well.” The Peabodies began to work at the pot. It soon became clear to Malvin that he wouldn’t be able to keep up with what they were doing. ChiffChaff would announce the name of something unknown to Malvin, a word that didn’t sound like a word, like hearing a made up language, and either Krill or Lional would dart forward to hand something over to ChiffChaff. A large wooden spurtle was brought over and placed in the pot. ChiffChaff would clutch onto its handle and beat its wings, creating a stirring motion. A dark black smoke began to spill from the pot and at some point the Peabodies had started chanting more words that didn’t sound like words. It was hard for Malvin to focus, that curling black smoke was fragrant and warm, it made Malvin feel drowsy. His vision became bleary with sleep and the chanting became a lullaby set against the pleasant twinkle of a windchime. Malvin stumbled on his feet. He set himself down beside a sack of grainy looking plants. His head was drooping, bouncing back up whenever Malvin realised he was falling asleep. He couldn’t fight it off forever. Malvin just managed to see ChiffChaff holding a glowing flower over the pot before his head lulled forward for a final time and he fell into a comforting sleep. He dreamed of a red haired girl, smiling and laughing.






“-and you have to bring him fresh Burginmille Leaves, they’ll help his knee,” Lional was hopping up with yet another small sack of gifts for Elder Manfrey. Malvin bent down, struggling with the numerous packages he already had.

“And ye take this letter, but don’t read it!” Krill yelled at Malvin. Glancing at the messy scrawls all over the parchment paper Malvin wasn’t sure he could read it if he tried. ChiffChaff chuckled from its perch on Malvin’s shoulder. 

“Yes Malvin here will make sure Manfrey gets all your heartfelt gifts and messages, now away with you, I will see him off.”

“Well don’t ye get lost… or lose anything!”

“Goodbye Malvin, it was nice to meet you.” Lional smiled and waved while Krill made what Malvin could only assume was a rude gesture with its hand before they left, headed back in the direction of the cave they called home. Malvin watched them go for a while before turning back to what was in front of him, to the Line. It was odd to be on this side of the Line, looking back into his world. From this side the human world, his home, looked alien. The mundane trees and simple foliage looked wrong and out of place. He wondered if the feeling would change once he stepped over the Line. Nestled against his chest was a small vial, a tincture that the Peabodies had made for him from the Hope’s Blossom, it hung around his neck on a thin string loop. Now he was ready to return, to do what he intended from the start, to cure Cressida. Yet nerves and trepidation trembled through him. Once he cured Cressida what then? Would he be able to fix anything between them?

“Faltering at the last hurdle?” ChiffChaff asked from his shoulder.

“Just… what comes next? After I save her… how do I stop myself from making the same mistakes?” 

“Remember I’m not your fairy godmother.” ChiffChaff chuckled, “but if you’re struggling to step across, remember your purpose.” ChiffChaff beat his wings and began rising into the strange sky, “what was your mantra?” it called down, “forwards to save her?”. Malvin thought for a moment,

Forwards to save Her.

He let his worries slowly seep out of him. Malvin stepped over the line back into the human world.

<h2>A Car Ride in a Red Car</h2>

A bright red car was stuck in traffic. A heavy traffic that is best described as a jam. Neave was driving the bright red car, stuck somewhere in the middle of the long queue. Her hands were clenched on the wheel and her teeth were grinding. The reason for her agitation was sat in the passenger seat. Matt was curled round in his seat, arm stretched toward the radio dial. He gave it an imprecise twist and the music changed jarringly; from electro house to classical. Neave’s hands tightened on the wheel. The swooning and keening of the classical music felt like a knife inside of her head. Being constantly vigilant for the traffic to move combined with the thrum of the car’s engine had given her a headache, and now this wasn’t helping. Matt was swaying his head to the orchestral sound. Neave could tell he wasn’t really feeling it and suspected he would change the station before long. She began a silent prayer that he would leave it alone, or better yet turn it off. Unfortunately after a couple more notes Matt’s hand began to search out the radio dial once more. With a casual spin the sombre tones were switched to the needling voice of an over enthusiastic reporter. Neave screwed up her face and turned to the window on her right. She had an urge to be outside on the pavement with the other pedestrians, walking in the cool fresh air, the rumble of the traffic only an annoyance rather than an oppressive pressure. She closed her eyes trying to savour the daydream, avoiding the reality. Twist. The latest pop poured out, unapologetically mundane. She sighed, she was stuck in the car with Matt’s aimless flitting between stations. Twist. Rock anthems blared out angry and emotive, pounding against Neave’s head. Twist. A sickly, curdling nursery rhyme oozed out of the speaker. Twist. An ancient audio drama wheezed away. Twi-                                                                                                 
<Br>
“Would you stop doing that!” Neave’s yell interrupted the clacking of the dial. Matt looked up at her with bewilderment, which Neave found infuriating.              
<Br>
“Stop what?” He asked with genuine confusion.                                                                                                                         
<Br>
“That! Flitting through the radio, it. Is. Maddening..”                                                                                                                        
<Br>
“I’m just trying to find something interesting to listen to.”                                                                                                                 
<Br>
“Well don’t okay, you keep changing it and I can’t focus on driving.”                                                                                                         
<Br>
Matt looked out the front windscreen at the motionless car less than five inches in front of them. “We’re not going anywhere,” he started reaching for the dial again, “might as well find something good to listen to.”                                                                                                             
<Br>
Neave slapped his hand down, “you already found something good to listen to five bloody…” she flicked her left hand frantically, mockingly mimicking Matt twisting the dial, blowing air through her teeth harshly, “…ago!” She turned away from Matt to focus on the road ahead. There was still a car blocking her path. She continued in a quieter, less aggressive tone. “Please, I’m stuck in here with you and I could really do without the mindless noise okay.” At that moment Neave felt the weight of being trapped with Matt, she realised she’d been carrying it around with her for a while.                                                              
<Br>
“It’s not mindless,” Matt protested. “It’s what the radio is for, that’s why they give you a dial to flip through the stations.” Neave just shook her head in response so Matt continued. “You’ve got to listen to a little bit of everything you can.” His voice was becoming more animated. “You find a song you like,” he flipped the radio onto a new song, “you listen to the good bit, the bit you like,” he rocked his shoulders back and forth to a pop song’s chorus, “then you change,” the dial clacked over to another song. “See, get the best out of the most you can,” Matt had a swaggering smile on his face. Neave wasn’t impressed.        
<Br>
“Well again could you not just jump around from one thing to another when I’m trying to do something,” the car in front moved forward a length, Neave followed. “You do this all the time.”                                                                                                                                          
<Br>
Matt looked up, “ I do what all the time?”                                                                                                                                  
<Br>
“That! Jumping from one meaningless thing to another meaningless thing, its… its honestly pathetic,” Neave couldn’t keep the scorn from her voice, “like you can’t make up your mind, you’re just- you’re just directionless.” Neave let out a ragged breath in exasperation. Letting out tension that had coiled under the surface for too long.                                                                                                                                                                 
<Br>
“What do you mean?” Matt asked in a quiet voice.                                                                                                                             
<Br>
“Well what are you doing with yourself? You spent all that time and money on those little things-“                                                                             
<Br>
“Warhammer.”                                                                                                                                                                  
<Br>
“And now they’re just sitting in a box.” The pair jolted in their seats as Neave over aggressively drove them forward a single car length. “Then there was that photography stint you went on, didn’t even send anything in to that competition I found for you.”                                                                              
<Br>
“Competition takes the fun out of it.”                                                                                                                                       
<Br>
“And you picked up that PT qualification thing…once again did nothing with it.” Neave gave a mirthless laugh. “You’re just doing nothing with yourself.”                       
<Br>
“Right.” There was pause. “Don’t know why you’re being so aggressive about it, that’s what you’re supposed to do,” Matt stated.                                                
<Br>
“WHAT!?” Neave exploded in shock, turning her disbelieving face towards Matt.                                                                                                     
<Br>
“What?”                                                                                                                                                               
<Br>
“That is not how life is supposed to be lived” Neave scoffed.                                                                                                             
<Br>
“Sure it is, you gotta try stuff in life” Matt had a rare intensity in his eyes, “give things a go and keep doing what you enjoy, don’t worry about what comes of it,  it’s your experience that matters.”                                                                                                                                    
<Br>
Neave returned her eyes to the road, shaking her head. Her foot weakly tapped against the pedal, still unable to go anywhere, “that sounds pointless to me.”             
<Br>
“It’s not pointless!” Came the protest,  “it’s an experience, and that’s the goal”                                                                                            
<Br>
“No the goal is to do… something, leave the world better than how you found it.” Neave continued with her own passion bubbling away, “you do something that can actually impact people, and then you work at it tirelessly, over and over…” Space opened up in front of them and Neave paused to drive the car forwards. “Until you’ve finally achieved something great.”                                                                                                                            
<Br>
“That sounds limiting” Matt turned towards Neave. She badly wanted to be out of the car, anywhere but here. She sighed and leant back into her seat, there was nowhere to go. “Sounds like you’re trapped by expectation.”                                                                                                              
<Br>
“I’m not trapped.”  Neave continued looking ahead at the unmoving car in front of them. “I’m working and improving. Working hard and I keep going because I know one day my works will be published and I will be amongst the greats having made a positive impact on people.” Neave slowly crossed her arms over her body.            
<Br>
“Right.” Matt was silent for a long time. So long that Neave turned to look at him. Still he remained silent, even as her glare hardened.                             
<Br>
“What?” She asked.                                                                                                                                                               
<Br>
“Well I just don’t think it works like that Neave.”                                                                                                                                      
<Br>
“It does.”                                                                                                                                                            
<Br>
“I mean if you’ve got a path fine, but what about all the other paths?” He gazed out of the passenger window, at the passersby on the pavement and the sparse trees and bushes. “And making it great? That doesn’t really happen this day and age. It’s say what we want you to say, what sells, or try again next time.” The car in front of them pulled forward, “you can’t advance this great plan of yours, you’re no closer to publishing your writing, because there’s no room for you. You’re wasting your time far more than me I would argue.” There was silence in the car for the moment.                                                                        
<Br>
“You think I’m wasting my time?”                                                                                                                                        
<Br>
Matt shrugged, “it’s not as if your achieving anything chipping away at the stone wall of greatness. It’s not me that’s pathetic, it’s not being able to let go of something that’s going nowhere that’s pathetic.”                                                                                                                     
<Br>
“Fuck you.” Neave said in a quiet voice. The engine thrummed and nothing else was said. The atmosphere in the car was palpable and thick. The pair each looked out of their separate windows, uncomfortably aware of each other’s presence. Equally aware that they would have to suffer that presence for the rest of the car ride. The thought turned Neave’s stomach. Twisted it up inside her until she had to speak, “perhaps we should call it a day.” Matt didn’t respond. “I mean us, we should break up,” Neave continued, the dread of that horrible atmosphere between them spurred her on, “we clearly want different things out of life and want to pursue our own choices. We’re just… too different as people.”                                                                                                                      
<Br>
“Yeah, you’re right.” Matt agreed. Neave was only mildly surprised at the lack of sting she felt hearing him agree. The silence returned. It stuck around for two more car lengths, until Matt decided to break it. “Of course we’d be lucky to break up.”                                                                                  
<Br>
“What?”                                                                                                                                                              
<Br>
“We’d be lucky to like, actually break up.” Matt stared at the radio apparently lost in thought as Neave turned to look at him.                                               
<Br>
“What do you mean?”                                                                                                                                                           
<Br>
“Breaking up just isn’t viable really, I mean, we’re going to see your parents, and your parents love me, you’ve said how they haven’t approved of anyone like me.” It was true they really did approve of Matt. “Then there’s our friends, we don’t have individual friends any more we have couple friends, what’s going to happen there?”                                                                                                                                                                      
<Br>
Neave considered these arguments and began to feel a sinking feeling in the middle of her chest that only worsened as Matt continued.                                            
<Br>
“And if we did actually break up? We’re late twenties, early thirties, do you know how difficult it is to find a friend that age let alone a romantic partner? We’d be screwed, lonely and bitter.” Matt didn’t sound triumphant or insistent, if anything he sounded apologetic. “Plus the flat and our money. Having to split all that up is going to be an absolute ball ache,” Matt looked at Neave, “don’t you think?” The sinking feeling inside her hit bottom. Neave shrugged. She knew he was right. Too much had gone into the relationship; emotionally, financially, logistically. They were locked in this relationship together and sooner or later this would just be another fight, overlooked or forgotten for the sake of a relationship that was good enough. Pleasant but not passionate. Matt didn’t press further. He reached out toward the radio once more, turning it back on. He resumed flipping through the stations but this time he turned the volume way down, so the sound of the radio was barely more than a faint hiss in the background. Neave kept to the pace of the traffic jam. “The last two weren’t bad” she said nodding towards the radio.                                                                                                                                                                    
<Br>
“Yeah?” Matt flipped the station back two stations, to some R&B station, “got a nice rhythm to it.” Matt nodded his head along to the music.                               
<Br>
Together they continued their trip to her parents. The car ride. The journey through life. They still had at least a few miles left in them.
