<h2>A Car Ride in a Red Car</h2>

A bright red car was stuck in traffic. A heavy traffic that is best described as a jam. Neave was driving the bright red car, stuck somewhere in the middle of the long queue. Her hands were clenched on the wheel and her teeth were grinding. The reason for her agitation was sat in the passenger seat. Matt was curled round in his seat, arm stretched toward the radio dial. He gave it an imprecise twist and the music changed jarringly; from electro house to classical. Neave’s hands tightened on the wheel. The swooning and keening of the classical music felt like a knife inside of her head. Being constantly vigilant for the traffic to move combined with the thrum of the car’s engine had given her a headache, and now this wasn’t helping. Matt was swaying his head to the orchestral sound. Neave could tell he wasn’t really feeling it and suspected he would change the station before long. She began a silent prayer that he would leave it alone, or better yet turn it off. Unfortunately after a couple more notes Matt’s hand began to search out the radio dial once more. With a casual spin the sombre tones were switched to the needling voice of an over enthusiastic reporter. Neave screwed up her face and turned to the window on her right. She had an urge to be outside on the pavement with the other pedestrians, walking in the cool fresh air, the rumble of the traffic only an annoyance rather than an oppressive pressure. She closed her eyes trying to savour the daydream, avoiding the reality. Twist. The latest pop poured out, unapologetically mundane. She sighed, she was stuck in the car with Matt’s aimless flitting between stations. Twist. Rock anthems blared out angry and emotive, pounding against Neave’s head. Twist. A sickly, curdling nursery rhyme oozed out of the speaker. Twist. An ancient audio drama wheezed away. Twi-                                                                                                 
<Br>
“Would you stop doing that!” Neave’s yell interrupted the clacking of the dial. Matt looked up at her with bewilderment, which Neave found infuriating.              
<Br>
“Stop what?” He asked with genuine confusion.                                                                                                                         
<Br>
“That! Flitting through the radio, it. Is. Maddening..”                                                                                                                        
<Br>
“I’m just trying to find something interesting to listen to.”                                                                                                                 
<Br>
“Well don’t okay, you keep changing it and I can’t focus on driving.”                                                                                                         
<Br>
Matt looked out the front windscreen at the motionless car less than five inches in front of them. “We’re not going anywhere,” he started reaching for the dial again, “might as well find something good to listen to.”                                                                                                             
<Br>
Neave slapped his hand down, “you already found something good to listen to five bloody…” she flicked her left hand frantically, mockingly mimicking Matt twisting the dial, blowing air through her teeth harshly, “…ago!” She turned away from Matt to focus on the road ahead. There was still a car blocking her path. She continued in a quieter, less aggressive tone. “Please, I’m stuck in here with you and I could really do without the mindless noise okay.” At that moment Neave felt the weight of being trapped with Matt, she realised she’d been carrying it around with her for a while.                                                              
<Br>
“It’s not mindless,” Matt protested. “It’s what the radio is for, that’s why they give you a dial to flip through the stations.” Neave just shook her head in response so Matt continued. “You’ve got to listen to a little bit of everything you can.” His voice was becoming more animated. “You find a song you like,” he flipped the radio onto a new song, “you listen to the good bit, the bit you like,” he rocked his shoulders back and forth to a pop song’s chorus, “then you change,” the dial clacked over to another song. “See, get the best out of the most you can,” Matt had a swaggering smile on his face. Neave wasn’t impressed.        
<Br>
“Well again could you not just jump around from one thing to another when I’m trying to do something,” the car in front moved forward a length, Neave followed. “You do this all the time.”                                                                                                                                          
<Br>
Matt looked up, “ I do what all the time?”                                                                                                                                  
<Br>
“That! Jumping from one meaningless thing to another meaningless thing, its… its honestly pathetic,” Neave couldn’t keep the scorn from her voice, “like you can’t make up your mind, you’re just- you’re just directionless.” Neave let out a ragged breath in exasperation. Letting out tension that had coiled under the surface for too long.                                                                                                                                                                 
<Br>
“What do you mean?” Matt asked in a quiet voice.                                                                                                                             
<Br>
“Well what are you doing with yourself? You spent all that time and money on those little things-“                                                                             
<Br>
“Warhammer.”                                                                                                                                                                  
<Br>
“And now they’re just sitting in a box.” The pair jolted in their seats as Neave over aggressively drove them forward a single car length. “Then there was that photography stint you went on, didn’t even send anything in to that competition I found for you.”                                                                              
<Br>
“Competition takes the fun out of it.”                                                                                                                                       
<Br>
“And you picked up that PT qualification thing…once again did nothing with it.” Neave gave a mirthless laugh. “You’re just doing nothing with yourself.”                       
<Br>
“Right.” There was pause. “Don’t know why you’re being so aggressive about it, that’s what you’re supposed to do,” Matt stated.                                                
<Br>
“WHAT!?” Nim exploded in shock, turning her disbelieving face towards Matt.                                                                                                     
<Br>
“What?”                                                                                                                                                               
<Br>
“That is not how life is supposed to be lived” Neave scoffed.                                                                                                             
<Br>
“Sure it is, you gotta try stuff in life” Matt had a rare intensity in his eyes, “give things a go and keep doing what you enjoy, don’t worry about what comes of it,  it’s your experience that matters.”                                                                                                                                    
<Br>
Neave returned her eyes to the road, shaking her head. Her foot weakly tapped against the pedal, still unable to go anywhere, “that sounds pointless to me.”             
<Br>
“It’s not pointless!” Came the protest,  “it’s an experience, and that’s the goal”                                                                                            
<Br>
“No the goal is to do… something, leave the world better than how you found it.” Neave continued with her own passion bubbling away, “you do something that can actually impact people, and then you work at it tirelessly, over and over…” Space opened up in front of them and Neave paused to drive the car forwards. “Until you’ve finally achieved something great.”                                                                                                                            
<Br>
“That sounds limiting” Matt turned towards Neave. She badly wanted to be out of the car, anywhere but here. She sighed and leant back into her seat, there was nowhere to go. “Sounds like you’re trapped by expectation.”                                                                                                              
<Br>
“I’m not trapped.”  Neave continued looking ahead at the unmoving car in front of them. “I’m working and improving. Working hard and I keep going because I know one day my works will be published and I will be amongst the greats having made a positive impact on people.” Neave slowly crossed her arms over her body.            
<Br>
“Right.” Matt was silent for a long time. So long that Neave turned to look at him. Still he remained silent, even as her glare hardened.                             
<Br>
“What?” She asked.                                                                                                                                                               
<Br>
“Well I just don’t think it works like that Neave.”                                                                                                                                      
<Br>
“It does.”                                                                                                                                                            
<Br>
“I mean if you’ve got a path fine, but what about all the other paths?” He gazed out of the passenger window, at the passersby on the pavement and the sparse trees and bushes. “And making it great? That doesn’t really happen this day and age. It’s say what we want you to say, what sells, or try again next time.” The car in front of them pulled forward, “you can’t advance this great plan of yours, you’re no closer to publishing your writing, because there’s no room for you. You’re wasting your time far more than me I would argue.” There was silence in the car for the moment.                                                                        
<Br>
“You think I’m wasting my time?”                                                                                                                                        
<Br>
Matt shrugged, “it’s not as if your achieving anything chipping away at the stone wall of greatness. It’s not me that’s pathetic, it’s not being able to let go of something that’s going nowhere that’s pathetic.”                                                                                                                     
<Br>
“Fuck you.” Neave said in a quiet voice. The engine thrummed and nothing else was said. The atmosphere in the car was palpable and thick. The pair each looked out of their separate windows, uncomfortably aware of each other’s presence. Equally aware that they would have to suffer that presence for the rest of the car ride. The thought turned Neave’s stomach. Twisted it up inside her until she had to speak, “perhaps we should call it a day.” Matt didn’t respond. “I mean us, we should break up,” Neave continued, the dread of that horrible atmosphere between them spurred her on, “we clearly want different things out of life and want to pursue our own choices. We’re just… too different as people.”                                                                                                                      
<Br>
“Yeah, you’re right.” Matt agreed. Neave was only mildly surprised at the lack of sting she felt hearing him agree. The silence returned. It stuck around for two more car lengths, until Matt decided to break it. “Of course we’d be lucky to break up.”                                                                                  
<Br>
“What?”                                                                                                                                                              
<Br>
“We’d be lucky to like, actually break up.” Matt stared at the radio apparently lost in thought as Neave turned to look at him.                                               
<Br>
“What do you mean?”                                                                                                                                                           
<Br>
“Breaking up just isn’t viable really, I mean, we’re going to see your parents, and your parents love me, you’ve said how they haven’t approved of anyone like me.” It was true they really did approve of Matt. “Then there’s our friends, we don’t have individual friends any more we have couple friends, what’s going to happen there?”                                                                                                                                                                      
<Br>
Neave considered these arguments and began to feel a sinking feeling in the middle of her chest that only worsened as Matt continued.                                            
<Br>
“And if we did actually break up? We’re late twenties, early thirties, do you know how difficult it is to find a friend that age let alone a romantic partner? We’d be screwed, lonely and bitter.” Matt didn’t sound triumphant or insistent, if anything he sounded apologetic. “Plus the flat and our money. Having to split all that up is going to be an absolute ball ache,” Matt looked at Neave, “don’t you think?” The sinking feeling inside her hit bottom. Neave shrugged. She knew he was right. Too much had gone into the relationship; emotionally, financially, logistically. They were locked in this relationship together and sooner or later this would just be another fight, overlooked or forgotten for the sake of a relationship that was good enough. Pleasant but not passionate. Matt didn’t press further. He reached out toward the radio once more, turning it back on. He resumed flipping through the stations but this time he turned the volume way down, so the sound of the radio was barely more than a faint hiss in the background. Neave kept to the pace of the traffic jam. “The last two weren’t bad” she said nodding towards the radio.                                                                                                                                                                    
<Br>
“Yeah?” Matt flipped the station back two stations, to some R&B station, “got a nice rhythm to it.” Matt nodded his head along to the music.                               
<Br>
Together they continued their trip to her parents. The car ride. The journey through life. They still had at least a few miles left in them.
